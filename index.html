            <p class="offer-package-description">
              The forest is a complex ecosystem consisting mainly of trees that
              buffer the earth and support a myriad of life forms. The trees
              help create a special environment which, in turn, affects the
              kinds of animals and plants that can exist in the forest. Trees
              are an important component of the environment. They clean the air,
              cool it on hot days, conserve heat at night, and act as excellent
              sound absorbers.

            <p class="offer-package-description">
              Low rainfall, wildland fires, and grazing by animals are three
              factors that maintain grasslands. In grassland regions, the
              climate is ideal for the growth of grasses only. The low
              precipitation rates are enough to nourish grasses but not enough
              for a forest of trees. Frequent fires also play a role in
              maintaining grassland ecosystems. Grasses are well adapted to grow
              back after a fire.

              Marine ecosystems are aquatic environments with high levels of
              dissolved salt, such as those found in or near the ocean. Marine
              ecosystems are defined by their unique biotic (living) and abiotic
              (nonliving) factors. Biotic factors include plants, animals, and
              microbes; important abiotic factors include the amount of sunlight
              in the ecosystem, the amount of oxygen and nutrients dissolved in
              the water, proximity to land, depth, and temperature.

              A lake is a body of water that is surrounded by land. There are
              millions of lakes in the world. Lakes vary greatly in size. Some
              measure only a few square meters and are small enough to fit in
              your backyard. Such small lakes are often referred to as ponds.
              Lakes also vary greatly in depth. So, you will have various
              factors to choose from.

              Mountains are landforms that rise prominently above the
              surrounding landscape. They are topographic features that are
              defined by a high relief, and their most general features are that
              they encompass a certain elevational range, have steep slopes, and
              converge toward small summit areas. The diversity of mountains is
              limitless.

            <p class="offer-package-description">
              Rivers and Streams are places where water is being transported
              from one place to another. With few exceptions, rivers take the
              water that collects in a watershed and ultimately deposits that
              water in the ocean. Along the way, the river biome serves as an
              important life-giving source to many plants and animals. Rivers
              are not static places; they change over time. A river has a way of
              picking up and depositing sediment which helps change its shape.
              As a river bends, the speed of the water changes.

          <p class="history-para">
            Animal Kingdom is project done by ExtraTerrestrial Company (also referred as ETC), the best
            company in field of terraforming planets and furthering lifeforms
            through their evolutionary paths. Animal Kingdom has been done on
            many planets, and it has never failed. Such successful projects
            include planets like "Saroth", "Xyz" and "Earth" (named by living beings on those planets).
          </p>
          <p class="history-para">
            Project implemented on "Earth" was such a success that ETC decided to
            redo AK on "Earth" again. And once again, ETC, will provide the best of it's
            services and terraform planet and give fresh start, not just to one
            race, as that was the company rule, but to the few races at once. Of
            course, "Fresh Start" is a process of evolving lifeforms in their
            evolutionary paths, with a goal of making the most suitable lifeform
            to live. On "Earth", lifeforms that underwent this process were "humans", but
            in second implementation of AK, "humans" won't be allowed to go
            through the process again, to be fair to other lifeforms, of course.
          </p>
          <p class="history-para">
            ExtraTerrestrial Company is a company that does not fail, but succeed, and that's why our customers are satisfied with the offers that are provided to them.
            After all, various packages that detail all the environments and variety of environments are clear result of ETC providing the best they can.
