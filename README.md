<h3>Daily UI 012</h3>

<p>
In this Challenge I was supposed to make e-commerce shop, which I think I did? My project is selling one product and
I do think that also qualifies as project requirement.

I did make sure to uphold all those rules, but one. I did not put brand I created because I do not like it.
That change happened because I realised I went with storyline of some Aliens came to Earth to wipe Humans, result
of previous "Animal Kingdom Project" of those same Aliens. That's why they decided to put this e-commerce shop (that I made) 
as a "shop" to all the animals they gifted with "Intelligence". And for this reason, I decided I needed to change brand I made,
into something more ominous. And also, this gave me idea for a game I will be creating XD

Well, onwards to another project/challenge!
